            <p class="population-para">Tallahassee, located in the Florida Panhandle region, is well-known as being a
                college town, with a student population that
                exceeds 70,000. The
                city's population is 201,731 as of 2022. That makes Tallahassee the eigth-most populated urban city in
                FL, according to Wikipedia(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida"

            <h2>Tallahassee's history</h2>
            <p>Legislators had to do government business between Augustine and Pensacola. Unfortunately, the traveling
                was very dangerous and took 20 days! Tallahassee was founded as Florida's state capital, as it was the
                midway point between the two principal cities.</p>

            <!--TALLAHASSEE ECONOMY-->
            <h2>Tallahassee's Economy</h2>
            <p>According to Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Florida"
                    target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Florida</a>), Florida's average income
                level is
                $47,684 whereas Tallahassee's was $23,778. But seeing as how Tallahassee is mostly a town made up of
                college
                students, that's not too surprising of a number. </p>
