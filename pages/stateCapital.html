            <h2>Tallahassee's history</h2>
            <p>Legislators had to do government business between Augustine and Pensacola. Unfortunately, the traveling
                was very dangerous and took 20 days! Tallahassee was founded as Florida's state capital, as it was the
                midway point between the two principal cities.</p>
