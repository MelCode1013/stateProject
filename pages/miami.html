        <h1>¡Buenvenidos a Miami!</h1>

            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>As of the 2020 census, Miami is home to 442,241 people in South Florida. The majority of the city's
                population is Hispanic and Latino, making up 70.2% of the population. Having a density of 4,884.8/sq mi,
                this classifies miami as an urdan city. Many people flock to Miami for its Latin flair and vibrant
                nightlife, but in turn, causes overcrowding in this fast-growing city.</p>

                <h3>Miami's Economy</h3>
                <p>In 2016, Michelle Kaufman wrote an article in the Miami Herald titled "Is Miami such a bad place to
                    live? It's 'the worst,' this study says". In the article, she states that the average home in Miami
                    cost $245,000, while the national average was $181,200. And the average houseold income was only
                    $31,917 - leaving families unable to afford housing.</p>

            <h2>Founding</h2>
            <p>Did you know Miami was actually founded by a woman named Jula Tuttle? She was a local citrus grower and
                the original owner of the land in which the city was built on. Her crops survived the Great Freeze of
                1894-1895. This helped Miami growth tremedously and Miami was incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896.
