            <h2>Orlando's beginnings</h2>
            <p>In 1840, a small group of people grew up around Fort Gatlin, a fort built to protect settlers from Native
                American attacks during the Seminole war. The community was known as Jernigan, named after the Jernigan
                family. As the settlement expanded northward, the community changed its name to "Orlando".</p>
