        2.  an HTML-coded ordered list with at least three list items(perhaps the top landmarks in Miami and orlando)

        3.  an HTML-coded unordered list with at least three list items (a list of key restaurants or attractions)

        4.  I also need to create a form. Maybe a contact us page? Form doesn't need to officially work. Just needs to ""

            <p>Based on the chart above, you can see quite a steady increase in Florida's population. The percentage
                column displays what percentage the population increased from a previous year. What is especially
                interesting is the biggest spike in 2000 - a whopping 6.20%.</p>

                <h3>Home Sweet Home</h3>
                <p>The average Florida home is reported to have at least 2 people, with 85% of the population living in
                    the same home 1 year ago. Despite there being a huge latin community in south and central florida,
                    only 29.8% of households speak another language other than English at home!</p>
