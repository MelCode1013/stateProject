    <!-- TO DO
        1.  a link that opens an external website in a new window or tab using the target attribute (link outside to maybe a city page)

        2.  an HTML-coded ordered list with at least three list items(perhaps the top landmarks in Miami and orlando)

        3.  an HTML-coded unordered list with at least three list items (a list of key restaurants or attractions)

        4.  an HTML-coded table consisting of 3–6 columns and 3–6 rows to organize content (I can organize the population stats into a table) 
        I also need to create a form. Maybe a contact us page? Form doesn't need to officially work. Just needs to ""
